## Identifying neighborhood trends using NYC OpenData

Value Proposition:
When people move to New York, they often struggle to determine which neighborhood best suits their needs. They typically rely on forums like Reddit or word-of-mouth, which can be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming. Our project proposes a machine learning system that provides insights into the long-term appeal of different neighborhoods for people that are navigating the apartment hunt process.
We will leverage time series models to project neighborhood-relevant trends, helping users make informed decisions about where to live based on future conditions rather than just the present snapshot.

To improve decision-making, our system will include:
Time Series Forecasting for Key Neighborhood Metrics:
Rent Trends: Predicting future rental prices to help users gauge affordability over time.
Demographic Shifts: Forecasting changes in demographic distributions to provide insights into neighborhood evolution.
Safety Trends: Predicting trends in vehicle collisions and shootings to assess the potential long-term safety of an area.


CitiBike Accessibility Clustering:
Using a clustering model to identify neighborhoods with high CitiBike accessibility, using the number of CitiBike stations as a proxy for CitiBike infrastructure.


Status Quo & Business Metric:
Current Approach: People rely on Reddit, personal recommendations, or scattered online sources. These methods are subjective, inconsistent, and do not account for future trends.


ML Advantage: Our system provides a data-driven, forward-looking alternative, enabling users to make more strategic, long-term decisions about where to live.


Business Metrics for Success:
User satisfaction: Measured by follow-up surveys asking users if they found the system useful.
User Retention: How often people return to the tool for future searches.
Model Performance: Forecasting accuracy of rent, safety, and demographic trends.


By focusing on future projections, this system enhances decision-making for new residents while improving efficiency compared to the status quo.

### Detailed design plan

Our project follows a cloud-native (Unit 3) approach using Git to automate provisioning and deployment. Microservices are containerized in Docker and served through Kubernetes for scalability and fault tolerance. The CI/CD pipeline automates model retraining and logs results with MLflow (Unit 5). An ETL pipeline ingests data from NYC Open Data, processes it through data cleaning and transformation steps, and loads it into the data repository for training and inference. Offline data (Unit 8) is stored persistently using Chameleon resources, streaming pipelines (Unit 8) handle real-time updates. Persistent storage (Unit 8) will be used to ensure that trained models, logs, and artifacts persist beyond individual runs. Distributed training is accelerated using Ray Train (Unit 5), with hyperparameter tuning handled by Ray Tune for optimal performance (Unit 5). The infrastructure will ensure fast retraining, scalable deployment, and continuous optimization.

#### Model serving and monitoring platforms

We will be integrating our smaller models into one forcast. The projections outputted by this system will then be served to the user at a single API endpoint. We plan on exploring several model optimization techniques like graph optimizations and reduced precision but avoiding ones that require specific hardware backends. For system level required concurrency we plan on trying FastAPI and/or using dynamic batching for regulation. We plan on evaluating our models before joining them together to form the main forecasting system. While we will perform sanity checks on the forecasts is no ground truth so most evaluation will be done on the time series models. We will use canary testing to first open our service just to students moving to NYC before the service is open to the general public. Users will be able to leave feedback about if they thought the projections make sense and align with what they think of neighborhoods.
